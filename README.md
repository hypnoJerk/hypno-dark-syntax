## Hypno Dark Syntax theme

This theme was forked from one-dark-syntax, and changed a bit to my liking.
There's more blue, and a little less Orange. 
Current-line gutter number is now Blue.
Regular text is Blue.
Also highlight color is a nice opaque Blue.

Also each blue is a diff hue to make elements distinguishable.

Also there is a matching UI theme to one-dark-syntax(which this one is based off of)
[UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).
